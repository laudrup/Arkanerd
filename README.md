Just a simple Arkanoid like game for Java Mobile I created a couple of years a go.

Since J2ME seems to be *very* dead I haven't even been able to actually compile the old Java code.

Instead I've tried to convert the sources to C++ and SFML. That is currently work in progress but the game is actually playable in the current state although ugly and the code is still quite messy.
